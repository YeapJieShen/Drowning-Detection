# 🏊‍♂️ Drowning Detection Project

## 📘 Project Description
This project was developed as part of the **BMCS2133 Image Processing** course assessment.

The main goal is to detect and classify human activities in swimming pool environments, with a focus on identifying:
- 🏊 **Swimming**
- 🚶 **Treading Water**
- ⚠️ **Drowning**

We use a combination of **YOLOv11** for real-time human detection and a custom-built **CNN classifier** to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs) and classify the activity of each detected individual. This enables real-time drowning detection and alerting.
