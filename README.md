# Drowning Detection Project

## Project Description
This project is developed under the **BMCS2133 Image Processing** course as part of the course assessment project.

It aims to detect and classify human activities in swimming pools, specifically focusing on identifying:
- **Swimming**
- **Treading Water**
- **Drowning**

Using a combination of **YOLOv11** for human detection and a custom **CNN classifier**, we extract ROIs (Regions of Interest) and classify the person's activity for real-time drowning detection.
